title: Notes on Pluralism

## Bess Sadler and Chris Bourg, ["Feminism and the Future of Library Discovery"](http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/10425)

> Search software, in order to provide feminist interaction, needs to be particularly concerned with pluralism and self-disclosure because it deals with questions of relevancy and significance. A single, totalizing, or universal point of view to the questions “What is relevant?” and “What is significant?” is likely to re-create existing societal patterns of exclusion and marginalization.

- What might this concern look like?
- What are some ways we might design pluralism into an interface while also addresses relevancy and significance?
- Perhaps we should eschew relevance and significance entirely, and opt for (and disclose) different ways of displaying collections. One task here, would be to provide alternative discovery interfaxces that encode pluralism, in part, _by_ dropping relevance as a mode of organization and presentation.

> Libraries would do well to keep these lessons in mind as we adopt new technologies like linked data, which holds much promise for breaking the stranglehold of rigid categorization systems, but makes many of the same assumptions that the Google algorithms make — namely that the most commonly asserted statements must be the most true.

- Seems especialy useful to think of _specific ways_ Linked Data can be used to provide pluralistic alternatives to hierarchy, relevance, significance.


## Hope Olsen, ["How We Construct Subjects: A Feminist Analysis"](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/231609/pdf)

> Classification schemes, thesauri, subject headings, and other tools used in cataloging, indexing, and even metadata are grounded, to a greater or lesser degree, in logic and the hierarchy that grows from logic. (514)

> As we look at classification, it does indeed go beyond likeness and difference to take on the hierarchy implied by logic. (514)

> My interpretation—drawing together the advice of Hekman, Grosz, Spivak, and Fuss—is that these approaches need not be mutually exclusive, especially if we begin with a poststructural rejection of universality. As long as we reject any notion that traditional/Aristotelian logic is the logical structure, instead viewing it as a logical structure, it is possible to include models that are radically different and to allow multiple models to coexist—separately or layered or even integrated with each other. Such an approach is necessary if we are to apply it to anything as concrete and ponderous as standards for the organization of information. It also acknowledges that while existing standards are biased and radical alternatives may be merited, existing tools do operate effectively for some con- texts. Hekman’s postmodern multiple paths offer the possibility of con- catenating the one model we have and any number of others. (522)

> Belenky et al. (1986) acknowledge their debt to Gilligan as they de- velop their theory of women’s ways of knowing (pp. 6–9). They identify  ve stages of knowing from silence to constructed knowing. The one that shows potential for the organization of knowledge and the one that most follows from Gilligan is the fourth: procedural knowledge (pp. 100–152). Procedural knowledge focuses on the techniques for acquiring knowl- edge, offering the most attention to structure of the  ve stages. Proce- dural knowledge has two manifestations: separate knowing and connected knowing. Separate knowing is exempli ed by distance between the know- ing subject and the object to be known and is based on traditional/Ar- istotelian logic (p. 114). Connected knowing privileges experience and relies on connections to others to discover what they know. The knowing subject learns through empathy, putting herself in the place of the object to be known rather than maintaining distance.

> On a spectrum from objectivist to subjectivist, connected knowing is somewhere in the middle. Separate knowing focuses on the known object while connected knowing acknowledges the role of the knowing subject. Connected knowing avoids the adversarial practices of traditional philos- ophy that focus on objectivity and validity, but it does maintain the notion of a singular concept of truth (Clinchy, 1996, pp. 212–215).

Two types of knowing: Separate knowing and connected knowing.


## Gilligan, _In A Different Voice_

> Illuminating life as a web rather than a succession of relationships, women portray autonomy rather than attachment as the illusory and dangerous quest. In this way, women’s development points toward a different history of human attachment, stressing continuity and change in conguration, rather than replacement and separation. (48)


> The images of hierarchy and web, drawn from the texts of men’s and women’s fantasies and thoughts, convey different ways of structuring relationships and are associated with different views of morality and self. (62)

Haraway, _A Cyborg Manifesto_

> So my cyborg myth is about transgressed boundaries, potent fusions, and dangerous possibilities which progressive people might explore as one part of needed political work. One of my premises is that most American socialists and feminists see deepened dualisms of mind and body, animal and machine, idealism and materialism in the social practices, symbolic formula-tions, and physical artefacts associated with 'high technology' and scientific culture. From One-DimensionalMan (Marcuse, 1964) to The Death of Nature (Merchant, 1980), the analytic resources developed by progressives have insisted on the necessary domination of technics and recalled us to an imagined organic body to integrate our resistance. Another of my premises is that the need for unity of people trying to resist world-wide intensification of domination has never been more acute. But a slightly perverse shift of perspective might better enable us to contest for meanings, as well as for other forms of power and pleasure in technologically mediated societies.

> From one perspective, a cyborg world is about the final imposition of a grid of control on the planet, about the final abstraction embodied in a Star Wars apocalypse waged in the name of defence, about the final appropriation of women's bodies in a masculinist orgy of war (Sofia, 1984). From another perspective, a cyborg world might be about lived social and bodily realities in which people are not afraid of their joint kinship with animals and machines, not afraid of permanently partial identities and contradictory standpoints. The political struggle is to see from both perspectives at once because each reveals both dominations and possibilities unimaginable from the other vantage point. Single vision produces worse illusions than double vision or many-headed monsters.
